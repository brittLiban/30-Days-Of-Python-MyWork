#NOTES 

# Everytime you want to print something - do it with a print()... This will lead to printing something to the console. 

print(2+3)

print(2%3) #This will print the remainder... NOT THE ACTUAL DIVISION... this is called MODULUS - Useful to find even or odd nums

print(3//2) #This will remove the remainder and just return everything infront of the decimal

print('This is a string')
